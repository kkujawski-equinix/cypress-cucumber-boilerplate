Certainly! Live coding interviews often require candidates to demonstrate their coding skills and problem-solving abilities on the spot. Here are a few popular TypeScript live coding interview questions:

1.  FizzBuzz with a Twist:
    Write a function that takes a number n. For each number from 1 to n, print "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3, "Buzz" if divisible by 5, and "FizzBuzz" if divisible by both 3 and 5. For numbers not divisible by either, print the number itself.

2.  Palindrome Check:
    Write a function that takes a string and returns true if it's a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards), ignoring spaces, punctuation, and letter casing.

3.  Reverse Words:
    Write a function that takes a string of words separated by spaces and returns the string with the words reversed. E.g., "Hello World" should become "World Hello".

4.  Two Sum:
    Given an array of numbers and a target sum, write a function that finds two numbers in the array that add up to the target sum. Return their indices.

5.  Factorial:
    Write a function that calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer n.

6.  Binary Search:
    Implement a binary search algorithm that finds the index of a given element in a sorted array.

7.  Linked List Operations:
    Implement basic operations on a singly linked list, such as adding elements, removing elements, and reversing the list.

8.  Debouncing Search Input:
    Create a search input with a debounce feature. As the user types, wait for a short delay before triggering a search to avoid excessive API calls.

9.  Throttling Mouse Events:
    Implement throttling on mousemove events. Limit the rate at which a function is called when the mouse moves rapidly.

10. Promise Chaining:
    Write a sequence of asynchronous operations using Promises, such as fetching data from an API and performing transformations.

11. TypeScript Class and Interface:
    Design a TypeScript class with methods and properties. Extend the class using an interface and implement the methods.

12. Functional Programming:
    Solve a problem using functional programming concepts like map, filter, and reduce.

Remember that live coding interviews not only assess your coding skills but also your ability to think out loud, explain your thought process, and handle edge cases. Practice solving these types of problems under timed conditions to become comfortable with the interview format.
